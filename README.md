Project: Agentic AI for DICOM-FHIR Workflows
üí° Goal

Build a containerized AI system that:

    Connects to a FHIR server and PACS/DICOM node

    Submits DICOM images for auto-contouring or analysis

    Uses agents to orchestrate tasks (e.g., fetch ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí store)

    Outputs results as DICOM-RTSTRUCT and updates patient data in FHIR

üß± Project Components (Microservice Style)
1. agent_controller (Central AI Agent)

    Coordinates the steps needed for each goal

    Talks to other modules via APIs

    Implements LangChain, CrewAI, or Autogen (or your own finite-state machine)

Python Packages: langchain, pydantic, fastapi
2. dicom_handler (DICOM I/O Agent)

    Receives DICOM from PACS

    Converts to numpy/image for processing

    Stores back to DICOM or sends to next service

Python Packages: pydicom, pynetdicom, SimpleITK, dicomweb-client
3. fhir_handler (FHIR Agent)

    Communicates with the hospital FHIR server (e.g., HAPI FHIR, Google Cloud)

    Searches/Updates ImagingStudy, Patient, ServiceRequest

Python Packages: fhir.resources, requests, fhirclient
4. ml_processor (Autocontouring / Analysis Engine)

    Receives image data

    Runs a segmentation model (U-Net or plug in MONAI or other models)

    Outputs DICOM RTSTRUCT or annotated results

Python Packages: torch, monai, numpy, pydicom
5. storage_service (Optional)

    Stores results to local disk or object storage (e.g., MinIO, AWS S3)

    Keeps track of input-output mapping for auditing

üîÅ Agentic Workflow Example

Goal: "Analyze all pending CT scans for lung segmentation and store RTSTRUCT in PACS."

    agent_controller receives the goal

    Fetches ImagingStudies with status ‚Äúregistered‚Äù from fhir_handler

    For each ImagingStudy:

        Uses dicom_handler to download DICOM from PACS

        Sends to ml_processor for lung segmentation

        Creates RTSTRUCT via dicom_handler

        Stores back to PACS

        Updates ImagingStudy.status = available via fhir_handler




Stretch Goals

    üß† Trainable model with fine-tuning using MONAI and DICOM masks

    üìä Dashboard for job tracking

    üîí Authentication for FHIR and PACS

    üîÅ Retry/fallback agent behaviors

    üß† Tool-using agents that write their own DICOM pipelines
